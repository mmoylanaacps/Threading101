## Multi threaded coinflipper

[Example threading](https://replit.com/@MarkMoylan1/threadingExample-1#main.py)

You will create a program that will simulate flipping a coin 100,000,000 times.

1. Create a number of coinflipper threads.  The number of coins each thread will be responsible for flipping will be based on the number of threads.  You will keep track of the number of heads that were flipped in each thread.

**Predict what number of threads you think will make the program run the fastest?**

2. Add code to start and join your threads.

3. Display the total heads from all the threads. 

4. Time how long the program takes to run.

5. Adjust the number of threads, experiment with different number of threads.  See what appears to be optimal.  Why do you think that is the case?
